## Modular Android Applicaion
### This is an application for manage online shops in Modular Architecture in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose, Room, Coroutines, Flow , Data Store and Navigation Compose,Also, I use Material3 and Dynamic Color for this app, so in Android 12 and above, the user can change the theme of the app like Google apps..
